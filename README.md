# UrbanFlow
UrbanFlow is a transformative approach to urban mobility, tackling congestion head-on and contributing to pollution reduction by reducing the active time of vehicles used between two points while providing priority Junction crossing to emergency vehicles such as fire trucks and ambulances, potentially saving lives during critical emergencies.
